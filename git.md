1. #H2 **Git Workflow**
> The main purpose of git workflow appears to be protecting the main branch.
The most important step toward this is creating a branch called "develop" of of the main branch.
The developers then make individual branches out of this develop branch.
Only when all the features being worked on work well within the develop branch are they merged to the main branch.
This makes sure that work can be done without the risk of breaking what is already working.
Another benefit is that if code is already in production, fixes and features can be developed without interfering with a product that is running.
Git Workflow creates best practices across the team when a project involves numerous people. 
The image below shows what a good work flow would look like.
